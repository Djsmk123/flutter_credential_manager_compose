# API Reference

For Android and iOS please refer to [credential_manager](https://pub.dev/documentation/credential_manager/latest/credential_manager/credential_manager-library.html) library.


## Android


**Credential Manager** is a Jetpack API that supports multiple sign-in methods, such as username and password, passkeys, and federated sign-in solutions (such as Sign-in with Google) in a single API, thus simplifying the integration for developers.

Furthermore, for users, Credential Manager unifies the sign-in interface across authentication methods, making it clearer and easier for users to sign into apps, regardless of the method they choose.
