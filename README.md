[Credential Manager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials) is a Jetpack API that supports multiple sign-in methods, such as username and password, passkeys, and federated sign-in solutions (like Sign-in with Google) in a single API, simplifying integration for developers on Android. For iOS, it uses Keychain for storing credentials.

For users, Credential Manager unifies the sign-in interface across authentication methods, making it clearer and easier to sign into apps, regardless of the chosen method.
