Credential Manager is a Jetpack API that supports multiple sign-in methods, such as username and password, passkeys, and federated sign-in solutions (like Sign-in with Google) in a single API, simplifying integration for developers.

For users, Credential Manager unifies the sign-in interface across authentication methods, making it clearer and easier to sign into apps, regardless of the chosen method.  

For iOS, it uses [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) for storing passkeys and [Autofill](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/text_input/adding_password_autofill_support_to_your_app) for managing credentials.



For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials).
